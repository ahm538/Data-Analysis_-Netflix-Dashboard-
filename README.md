# Netflix Data Analysis Project â€“ Power BI Dashboard

This project is a complete end-to-end data analysis project on Netflix titles using Power BI. The dashboard delivers insights into movies and TV shows distributed by Netflix, based on genre, country, votes, runtime, and more.

## Tools Used
Power BI for data visualization
Excel/CSV files as data sources
DAX for measures and calculated columns

## Project Steps
### 1. Data Cleaning
Removed null and duplicate values.
Normalized columns (e.g., genre, countries).
Standardized date formats.
Split multi-value fields like genres and production countries.
Ensured data types were consistent for calculations and filtering.

### 2. Data Modeling
Built relationships between three tables: titles, credits, and mymoviedb.
Defined necessary measures (e.g., Vote Avg, Popularity, Runtime).
Created calculated columns for analysis (e.g., Yearly trends).

### 4. Data Visualization
Two report pages were created:

#### Page 1: General Overview
Total number of titles since 2020.
Runtime, IMDB, and TMDB averages.
Yearly release trend chart.
Most frequent actors and directors.
Movies vs. Shows ratio.

#### Page 2: Deep Dive into Movies
Vote Average, Vote Count, and Popularity indicators.
Top genres by vote average.
Top productive countries in film production.
Most popular movies by vote count.
World map of production countries.
Detailed table showing actor roles and movie names.
